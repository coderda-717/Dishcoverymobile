# 🍽️ Welcome to Dishcovery 👋

Dishcovery is a mobile app built with [**Expo**](https://expo.dev) and [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) that helps users discover, create, and share delicious recipes — all from the comfort of their kitchen.

This project uses [**Expo Router**](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for modern, file-based navigation.

---

## 🚀 Get Started


### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```


#### 2️⃣ Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the terminal, you’ll see options to open the app in:

. A development build

. An Android emulator

. An iOS simulator

. Or Expo Go
 — for quick testing on real devices



##### 🧭 Project Structure

Dishcovery uses Expo’s file-based routing, meaning your app’s navigation is built automatically from the folder structure.

/app
 ┣ /auth           → Login, Register, Forgot Password
 ┣ /(tabs)         → Main app screens (Home, Explore, Profile, etc.)
 ┣ _layout.js      → Global layout configuration

Most screens, layouts, and navigation stacks are defined in the /app directory.



###### 🧑‍🍳 Features

✅ Browse recipes by category
✅ View detailed recipe instructions and ingredients
✅ Add and save your favorite recipes
